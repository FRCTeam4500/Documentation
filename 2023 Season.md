## A New Year!

## The Challenges We Face

1.  Autonomous control: Teams will likely need to program their robots to perform specific actions without human input.
    
2.  Object recognition and manipulation: Robots may need to identify and pick up objects, such as cones or cubes, and place them in designated locations.
    
3.  Arm and gripper control: Teams will need to design and program an arm and gripper mechanism to pick up and place objects.
    
4.  Drive control: Robots will need to be able to move around the field in an efficient and controlled manner.
    
5.  Vision processing: Robots may need to use cameras to gather information about their surroundings, such as the location of objects or other robots.
    
6.  Obstacle avoidance: Robots will need to navigate around obstacles and avoid collisions with other robots and objects.
    
7.  Power management: Robots will need to be designed to efficiently manage their power supply, as they will be limited in the amount of energy they can use over the course of the competition.
    
8.  Stability: Robots need to maintain balance and stability while performing actions such as picking up and placing objects.
