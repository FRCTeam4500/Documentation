Hey Ya'll there really is no organization until the future, this is going to be a bit of a brain dump. If you want organization, we can add metadata to the files later to sort them into tables.

With that being said, please feel free to add to the documentation.

## How to add entries

#### Method 1
Download Obsidian for either windows or mac. Clone this repository. Open in Obsidian ("Open folder as vault")
It is good to use Obsidian because you can see connections between the files which can build your intuition surrounding the code.

#### Method 2
Clone this repository and add ".md"/markdown files and add info their.

Everyone should have write access, so a simple commit and push should work. 

**Make sure you pull** before working on entries in order to reduce merge conflicts.
