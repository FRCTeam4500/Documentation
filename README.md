Hey y'all there really is no organization until the future, this is going to be a bit of a brain dump. If you want organization, we can add metadata to the files later to sort them into tables.

## Things to do in Addition to reading these docs
Learn Java - Learning Core Java from W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp and Learning Functional Java from Amigoscode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRpHdSFWGPs. For the W3Schools link, I would skip the following sections: **Java Recursion, Java Abstraction, Java User Input, Date, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, Iterator, Wrapper Classes, RegEx, Thread, Lambda (maybe), also skip File Handling & the big sections after it**. For the Functional Programming Tutorial you should skip **Optionals & Callbacks**. Also, learn Decorators from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-with-example/. Also, going through any links inside of this documentation that leads to external sources (ex: we put a Limelight docs link in Vision.md). To be honest, use whatever source you want but refer to these sources to know what topics you need to learn. 

## How to add entries


#### Method 1
Download Obsidian for either windows or mac. Clone this repository. Open in Obsidian ("Open folder as vault")
It is good to use Obsidian because you can see connections between the files which can build your intuition surrounding the code. It also might be useful to learn how to use Obsidian. I recommend going through the first 6 videos of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd and also know how to have a link title that is not the same as the title of the page you're linking to. Make sure you use links in order to build the knowledge graph when you're typing out stuff in this documentation.

#### Method 2
Clone this repository and add ".md"/markdown files and add info there.

Everyone should have write access, so a simple commit and push should work. 

**Make sure you pull** before working on entries in order to reduce merge conflicts.
