Hey Ya'll there really is no organization until the future, this is going to be a bit of a brain dump. If you want organization, we can add metadata to the files later to sort them into tables.

With that being said, please feel free to add to the documentation.

## How to add entries

#### Method 1
Download Obsidian for either windows or mac. Clone this repository. Open in Obsidian ("Open folder as vault")
It is good to use Obsidian because you can see connections between the files which can build your intuition surrounding the code. It also might be useful to learn how to use Obsidian. I recommend going through the first 6 videos of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd and also know how to have a link title that is not the same as the title of the page you're linking to. Make sure you use links in order to build the knowledge graph when you're typing out stuff in this documentation.

#### Method 2
Clone this repository and add ".md"/markdown files and add info their.

Everyone should have write access, so a simple commit and push should work. 

**Make sure you pull** before working on entries in order to reduce merge conflicts.
