Here is an example using Arcade Drive (forward and backward, left and right) -> drive.arcadeDrive(xSpeed, zSpeed); I have no idea why it's "z", deal with it :). Also I would not recommend using the 
```java
// Initialize variables to store the readings from the gyro sensor 
double gyroAngle = 0.0; 
double gyroRate = 0.0; 
double gyroTime = 0.0; 

// Set the proportional, integral, and derivative gains for the PID controller 
double kP = 0.1; 
double kI = 0.01; 
double kD = 0.01; 

// Initialize the error, integral, and derivative terms for the PID controller 
double error = 0.0; 
double integral = 0.0; 
double derivative = 0.0; 

// Store the current time for use in the PID loop 
gyroTime = Timer.getFPGATimestamp(); 

// Continuously run the PID loop to balance the robot 

while (isAutonomous() && isEnabled()) { 
	// Update the gyro angle and rate readings 
	gyroAngle = gyro.getAngle(); 
	gyroRate = gyro.getRate(); 
	
	// Calculate the error between the target angle (0 degrees) and the current angle 
	error = 0.0 - gyroAngle; 
	
	// Calculate the integral of the error over time 
	integral += error * (Timer.getFPGATimestamp() - gyroTime); 
	
	// Calculate the derivative of the error with respect to time 
	derivative = (error - prevError) / (Timer.getFPGATimestamp() - gyroTime); 
	
	// Store the current error for use in the next iteration 
	prevError = error; 
	
	// Update the current time for use in the next iteration 
	gyroTime = Timer.getFPGATimestamp(); 
	
	// Calculate the correction value using the PID gains and error terms 
	double correction = kP * error + kI * integral + kD * derivative; 
	
	// Apply the correction value to the drive motors to keep the robot balanced 
	drive.arcadeDrive(0.0, correction); 
}
```

### Explanation
This code uses a [[PID]] ([[PID|proportional-integral-derivative]]) controller to balance the robot on the charging station. The [[Gyro|gyro]] sensor is used to measure the current angle of the robot, and the [[PID|PID controller]] uses this information to calculate a correction value that is applied to the drive motors to keep the robot balanced. The kP, kI, and kD variables store the gains for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the [[PID]] controller, respectively. The _error_ variable is the difference between the target angle (0 degrees) and the current angle, the _integral_ variable is the sum of the errors over time, and the _derivative_ variable is the rate of change of the error. The correction value is calculated by multiplying the error terms by the respective gains and summing them up. The "_drive.arcadeDrive_" function is used to apply the correction value to the drive motors. This will cause the robot to rotate on the charging station until it reaches the target angle of 0 degrees and stays balanced.
