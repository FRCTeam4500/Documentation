# What is Autonomous? 
Autonomous, or auto for short, refers to the first 15 seconds 
of the game, where the robot is run based not on driver input, but pre-written code.

# Outline of Our Auto Strategy This Year

This year, there are a few key points to understand:
- There are 3 starting positions
    - One on each side of the community
    - One in the middle of the community, in line with the charge station
- There are a total of 7 game pieces accessible to each alliance
    - 1 preloaded onto each robot for a total of 3
    - 4 placed in a straight line on the far side of the charge station
    - Each alliance can choose which game piece (cone or cube) is used for each slot
Due to the time taken to place and pick up, we only have enough time 
to either place 2 pieces or place one piece and dock on the charge station
