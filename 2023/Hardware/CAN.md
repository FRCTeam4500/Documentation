## What is CAN?
CAN stands for Controller Area Network which sends communication through the [[Motor|motors]] and receives information from the [[Motor|motors]]. You can use CAN to configure [[Motor|motor]] IDs.

## Configuring Motor IDs with CAN 
1. Power the [[RoboRio]]
2. Power the [[Motor|motor]]
3. Connect the CAN Loop into the [[Motor]] one motor at a time by using [[PheonixTuner]].
4. Use the [[PDH]] in order to power the [[Motor|motor]] while the CAN Loop sends comms through the robot.
